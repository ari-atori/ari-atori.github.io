			<h1>PITCHSTONE EDITOR</h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>Pitchstone Editor is a current project of mine that was originally developed in OpenGL and GLFW, but is ultimately being transitioned over to Vulkan and SDL3.</p>
			<p>Pitchstone is a modular, node-tree based video editor which allows for the use of custom primitive shaders and render jobs for videos. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>A decision was made this year after after the entire team dissolving, that I will rework on this program from scratch.</p>

			<p>Source code for the Video Editor will be made available in a later time, near the end of 2025.
			<p>Source code for the Filter Library will be made avialable in a later time, near the end of 2025.
			<p>We plan for beta testing for around 2027 or 2028, but all contributions and testing are welcome. </p>
			<p>Current build environment supports Ubuntu Linux. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>This page is a work in progress and will be updated over time.</p>
